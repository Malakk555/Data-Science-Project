# Data-Science-Project
This project aims to transform the articles of the Saudi Labor Law into a structured Questionâ€“Answer (Q&A) dataset that enables various beneficiary groups to quickly access legal texts. This highlights the importance of presenting these legal materials in a way that is clear, organized, and easily searchable for all users.
